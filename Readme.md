I do not own Pop Team Epic. Pop Team Epic is written and illustrated by Bkub Okawa, animated by Kamikaze Douga. Pop Team Epic and all logos, character designs  and names (Pipimi & Popuko) and distinctive likenesses thereof are trademarks of Bkub Okawa and Kamikaze Douga.  
This is nothing more than a Parody made for entertainment purposes only.
